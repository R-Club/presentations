160210 R-Club shiny | random, created inside the folders | February 10, 2016 | Felix presented how to make `shiny` apps with five examples. Each example has its own folder with two scripts - "server.R" and "ui.R" - which are needed for the app to run.
codon_enrichment and codon_enrichment_original | counts_from_pub.tab, regulation_from_pub.tab, Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_UCBPP-PA14_109.tab | May 25, 2016 | Sarah gave a brief overview of her ongoing analysis of codon enrichment following a publication from Deng et al. (2015) (see script codon_enrichment_original.R). The first script demonstrates how to count codons in sequence data inside R, while the second script tries to replicate the results from the publication with the published supplementary data.
